# Getting Started

## Requirements

-   [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    -   You'll know you did it right if you can run `git --version` and you see a response like `git version x.x.x`
-   [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    -   You'll know you've installed nodejs right if you can run:
        -   `node --version` and get an ouput like: `vx.x.x`
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) instead of `npm`
    -   You'll know you've installed yarn right if you can run:
        -   `yarn --version` and get an output like: `x.x.x`
        -   You might need to [install it with `npm`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) or `corepack`

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/stipanelez/Aave-v3.git
cd Aave-v3
yarn
```

1. Setup environment variabltes

You'll want to set your `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

-   `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
    -   You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
-   `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: This is url of the sepolia testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

2. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some tesnet ETH & LINK. You should see the ETH and LINK show up in your metamask. [You can read more on setting up your wallet with LINK.](https://docs.chain.link/docs/deploy-your-first-contract/#install-and-fund-your-metamask-wallet)

3. You can install @aave/aave-v3-core as an NPM package in your Hardhat or Truffle project to import the contracts and interfaces:

npm install @aave/aave-v3-core

Import at Solidity files:

import {IPool} from "@aave/aave-v3-core/contracts/interfaces/IPool.sol";
